# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- `QuoteCrudController` numbers a new quote in `persistRecord()`, omnibase/admin's write hook on the persistence the site
  chose, in place of the former `persistEntity(EntityManagerInterface)` (deprecated since the admin's step B1a); its
  repository is given by `setQuotes()`. Needs omnibase/admin from its step B1a (`persistRecord()`, 2026-11-08).

### Changed
- Accepts omnisense/omnibase 5.0 (`3.0.*-dev || 4.0.*-dev || 5.0.*-dev`; plan "omnibase agnostic", step S): the bundle runs
  unchanged on it, `Base\Bundle\AbstractBaseBundle` and the other former names it uses being aliases of
  omnibridge/symfony's classes there. The sites on 4.x resolve as before.
- `Software::__toLink()` link through `Base\Contract\Link::to()` (the Urls contract; the same address under
  Symfony, in the core 3.x and 4.x) instead of BaseTrait's `getRouter()->generate()`, which the
  core deprecates since BaseTrait names contracts only (omnisense/omnibase 4.x, step F2f).

### Fixed
- README: the package's name, omnibase/forge (the title was base-bundle-forge), omnisense/omnibase
  and omnibase/marketplace on GitHub in place of base-bundle and base-bundle-market on the
  abandoned gitlab.glitchr.dev, git/git-bundle's home, omnisense/omnistate (not glitchr/omnistate),
  and the core's requirement as composer.json states it (3.0 or 4.0).
